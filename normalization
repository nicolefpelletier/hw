This is how you would normalize the data for cereal.csv:

Table 1: BasicInformation
Fields: name(string), mfg(string), address(string)

Table 2: NutritionalInfo
Fields: name(string), calories(integer), protein(integer), fat(integer), sodium(integer), fiber(float), carbo(float), sugars(integer),
potass(integer), vitamins(integer), cups(float), rating(float)


Table 1 has the basic information of the cereal which includes the manufacturer and the address of the manufacturer
Table 2 has the name of the cereal as well as all the nutritional information. It also includes the cereal's health rating which is calculated
based on the nutritional information.

The primary key between the two tables is the name of the cereal(field name is "name").
